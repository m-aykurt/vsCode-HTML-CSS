    <p>
        The delay is due to the national approval process of events which requires approval from the National Sports Agency (Government Organization) and the Ministry of Health. The request is now with the Ministry of Health and their answer is expected soon. Member Federations will be notified about the outcome as soon as the Racice OC and World Rowing have received the Ministry of Health’s feedback.
